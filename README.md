**CORAL** is infrastructure for **autonomous AI agent organizations** that run experiments, share knowledge, and continuously improve solutions. Give it a codebase and a grader, and CORAL handles the rest: isolated workspaces, safe evaluation, persistent shared state, and multi-agent collaboration. Natively integrated with Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Cursor Agent, and Kiro.

### 🔥 News

- **[2026-04-24]** Rubric judges — two reusable LLM-judge grader packages for open-ended tasks (reports, memos, legal analysis). See the [Rubric Judges guide](https://docs.coralxyz.com/guides/rubric-judge).
- **[2026-04-03]** Our paper, "CORAL: Towards Autonomous Multi-Agent Evolution for Open-Ended Discovery," is now out! Check it out on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.01658v1).
- **[2026-03-18]** CORAL is released! Check out our [blog post](https://human-agent-society.github.io/CORAL/).

### Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Human-Agent-Society/CORAL/main/install.sh | sh
```

Installs `coral` globally via `uv tool install`. Pin a version with `CORAL_VERSION=v0.5.0`. See [Installation docs](https://docs.coralxyz.com/getting-started/installation) for manual install, dev setup, and prerequisites.

```bash
coral init my-task                       # scaffold a task
cd my-task && coral start -c task.yaml   # launch agents
```

### Supported Agents

| Agent | `agents.runtime` |
|-------|------------------|
| [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) — default | `claude_code` |
| [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) | `codex` |
| [Cursor Agent](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/overview) | `cursor` |
| [Kiro](https://kiro.dev) | `kiro` |
| [OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode) | `opencode` |

Each agent must be installed and authenticated separately. Per-runtime config — including the [LiteLLM gateway](https://docs.coralxyz.com/guides/gateway) for custom models — is documented at [Agent Runtimes](https://docs.coralxyz.com/guides/agent-runtimes).

### How It Works

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/coral_diagram_trans.jpg" alt="CORAL architecture diagram: multiple coding agents run in isolated git worktrees, share state via .coral/public/, and are scored by a grader daemon" width="800">
</p>

Each agent runs in its own git worktree. Shared state (attempts, notes, skills) lives in `.coral/public/` and is symlinked into every worktree — agents see each other's work in real time. A grader daemon scores every commit. The manager interrupts agents with heartbeat prompts (`reflect`, `consolidate`, `pivot`).

### Development

```bash
# Install dev dependencies
uv sync --extra dev

# Run tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Lint & format
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Docker requirement:** Some built-in graders (e.g. SWE-bench, terminal-bench) use [Harbor](https://github.com/corca-ai/harbor) to run evaluations inside Docker containers. CORAL itself must **not** run inside Docker in this case, as Docker-in-Docker (DinD) is not supported. Run CORAL directly on the host machine.
