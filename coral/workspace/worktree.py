      ``base_dir`` (typically the task directory) when not absolute.
    - **dest** is worktree-relative (e.g. ``.claude/settings.json``). Must
      stay inside the worktree — ``..`` and absolute paths are rejected.

    1. Run workspace setup commands (e.g. ``uv sync``) so the worktree
       gets its own ``.venv`` with task dependencies.
    2. Install ``coral`` into that venv so ``coral eval`` is available
       when the agent uses ``uv run``.

    Each worktree gets its own isolated ``.venv`` via UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT
    to prevent concurrent agents from corrupting a shared venv.

    Idempotent: if the worktree's ``.venv`` is already populated (the python
    binary exists), skip both the setup commands and the coral reinstall.
    Deps don't change mid-run, so re-running ``uv sync`` on every
    interrupt-and-resume cycle is wasted work. To force a re-sync, delete the
    ``.venv`` directory before resuming.
